Dear English Academy

Please allow me to take this opportunity to introduce myself as an English teacher. Even before I joined to other schools I was aware of the impact of the quality education that the school provides, on students who grow up to be responsible adults.

Leveraging my experience, I anticipate that I will be able to contribute highly to helping students meet their curriculum goals, and provide them with a wider view of perception of this form of art.

Since I have taught students ranging from ages 8 to 16, I am well aware of all levels of English literature education, and can quite comfortably incorporate technology into regular lessons. I believe this skill will help students in learning through both conventional means and modern ways.

I look forward to meeting you individually while learning the ropes so that my transition into the system is as smooth as possible.

 

Sincerely,

Mukhriddin Mike
